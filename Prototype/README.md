## Better Grocery List

### Prototype Details

This prototype features some mockups of the in progress Better Grocery List web app. So far the web app consists of 3 pages. The user will use this app to create grocery lists based on items in a database, or custom items that they can add in via a dialog box. 

## Main Page

Used for adding items to the active list from the database or user input. The top box will be a scrollable section with items from the database listed. The user can select a desired item from the list and then select the "Add item to list" button to have it added. If the user has another item they would like to add that is not present in the "common items", they can type in the text box at the bottom that will then add it to their active list. When the user wants to view/edit their active list, they can click the button in the top right.

## Active List Page

Shows the user their active list and allow them to select/remove items from it. The round selectors on the left allow the user to signify that the item is complete. The square selectors on the right allow the user the option to delete the item from the list if they want. The red button in the bottom right allows the user to clear the entire list, which then takes you to page 3.

## "Are you sure?" Page

Displays after the user selects "Clear Active List" from the previous page to make sure they don't accidentally delete their list. Yes deletes the list, and no returns them to the previous page.
